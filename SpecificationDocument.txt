Project and Developer Details
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is the Phase End Project for Phase one.
This project was developed by Bryan Nearing for the Simplilearn team for grading purposes.

This project does a couple of things that the user can interact with.
First, this project gives a welcome prompt to the user and offers 3 menu options

1) List all of the files in the directory -> Lists files and dirs in ascending order.
2) Show the user options for files in the directory -> Sends the user to the next menu for file options.
3) Exits the program

If the user selects option 2 they are sent to the second menu with the following options.

1) Add a file -> Creates a blank file with a name specified by the user.
2) Delete a file -> Deletes a file with a name specified by the user.
3) Search a file -> Searches for a file from the user and returns with a found/not found prompt
4) Return back to the main menu -> Returns to the previous menu



Sprint Planning
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was divided into 2 sprints.

1st Sprint
-----------------------------------------
This first sprint was used to design and code the Menu system.

The program flow was modeled after the design specifications given by the project.

The program flow can be shown in the flowchart.png included in the file submission

The menu system allows users to access all of the functions included in this project
and lets the user exit the program from the program flow.

2nd Sprint
-----------------------------------------
The second sprint was focused on adding in the functionality of the program.

With all of the methods already in the program, the challenge was to code the
appropriate logic. 

In this sprint, all of the logic was coded and exception handling was used to 
make sure there would be no interruption of the program from miscelaneous user input.



Algorithms and Flowchart
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The flowchart is added as a submission document called "flowchart.png". See this file for more details on the flow of the program.

There are 2 algorithms that were employed in this project.

1) Linear Search
When the user specifies that they want to search the directory for a file, the program takes in the filename and starts a search.
This search uses the linear search algorithm which enumerates over all of the files in the directory.
The the filename specified by the user matches a filename in the directory, the program outputs that the file was found in the directory 
or it was not found in the directory if the linear search came up empty.

2) Sort
One of the requirements of the project was listing all the files in the directory in ascending order.
The program first gets a String array of all of the file and directory names in the directory.
The program then uses the Collections.sort() method to sort the files in ascending order.
The Collections.sort() method uses the quicksort algorithm as defined by the java specifications.



Core Concepts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The core java concepts in this project are File handling, core java concepts, use of data structures,
and object oriented programming.
